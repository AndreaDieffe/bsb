# 2.3
This release is a prerelease of version 3.0 with finished simulator handling for the NEST simulator
and preliminary support for TreeCollections, tree pickling, MorphologyRepositories, morphologies, voxelization
and touch detection.

* Added MorphologyRepositories to preprocess and store morphologies before they are used in the placement/connectivity.
* Added TreeCollections to load, cache and store trees. OutputFormatters should know how to handle trees.
* HDF5Formatter can pickle trees.
* Simulations can be configured through SimulatorAdapters, should provide ConfigurableClasses to configure `cell_models`,
`connection_models` and `devices`.
* Implemented a NestAdapter with NestCells, NestConnections and NestDevices.
